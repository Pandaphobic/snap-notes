# SNAP Notes

This is a basic tool to help my workflow. It's primary purpose was to help me learn React and React Bootstrap as well as grasp hooks.
It is rendered client side so the idea is that you can host it on something like netlify and as long as you run the page once, you can use the tool continuously.

## Features

### Notes
Take pertinent caller information and jot down notes in a tabable interface. 

#### Name
The neat-o feature here is the name formatter. It accepts names in two formats:
Firstname Lastname
Lastname, Firstname

The cycle button allows you to cycle between these

### Schedule
The schedule app is only intended to work with Impact 360.

Select All on your schedule page and drag into the box. You can also copy and then paste the content into the box.
The Update button makes that schedule live.

### Outages
The outage section is an easy way to mark down current outages. It's main purpose is to flip to it rather than look through a bunch of different portals work side. 


## Build Instructions

From the src folder
run `npm intall`

run `npm run build` in the terminal to increment
Now you can deploy the public folder to something like netlify
OR
run `npm run start` to launch locally.
